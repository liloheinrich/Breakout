Improvement ideas:
- make ball change direction better when it bounces, so it doesn't just mirror the angle it was going before,
    making it less predictable and more fun
- add a score counter or timer - maybe display the count of how many bricks are left?
- track how many times they lost and how many won? percentage?
- add some sort of menu and end screen
- sound effects?
- different levels ex. goes faster each round, smaller paddle, more bricks or ones that take more hits
- add some nice looking color schemes, maybe even a color scheme selector option
