First of all, get together and go through
- what each other has learned/worked on since last class/meeting
- figure out how/when we will work together on this (live code editor apps? timezone?)
- how to split up work on the assignment
- what we have to turn in/do for our grade

Improvement ideas:
- work on the wall code to allow building custom walls with different colors and different numbers of hits required
- make ball change direction better when it bounces, so it doesn't just mirror the angle it was going before,
    making it less predictable and more fun
- add a score counter or timer - maybe display the count of how many bricks are left?
- track how many times they lost and how many won? percentage?
- add some sort of menu and end screen
- sound effects?
- different difficulty levels ex. goes faster each round, smaller paddle, more bricks or ones that take more hits
- add some nice looking color schemes, maybe even a color scheme selector option
- look up the Atari video game this is based on and see what else it does
