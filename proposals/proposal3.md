# Space shooter game
We want to make one of the classic games, space shooter, using the pygame library. By doing this, we will get to explore:

    Object-oriented programming
    Event-driven programming
    Computer Graphics  

Our minimum viable product includes having:

    A space ship that shoots. (one press one shot, hold for continuous shooting)
    The objects/targets
    Background (space)
    Scoreboard (timer)
    Ending the game by collision 

Our stretch goal is to add a couple of extra features such as:

    Different levels (more objects, higher speed etc)
    More types of objects or targets to hit
    Score history 
    Features to choose from different ships
    Ship feature upgrades
    Change in backgroud as game progress
    Background music
   
Our space shooter game is meant for anyone who wants to play games. The limitations are similar to breakout game. Since it is a primarily visual game, people with impaired vision may not be able to play. Also, the control interface is a computer mouse and keyboard, so anyone who cannot physically operate these devices would need some sort of controls adaptation in order to play. 

For each member, the learning goals are: to learn how to develop different kinds of game (Izumi) and to learn how to use the pygame library (Lilo).
