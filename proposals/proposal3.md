# Proposal 3

Your MP4 repo should have a proposal document (markdown or PDF, submit a link on Canvas) that describes the main idea of 3 projects.

Each of the three proposals in this document should address:
- What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
- What are your learning goals for this project (for each member)?
- What libraries are you planning to use? (if you donâ€™t know enough yet, please outline how you will decide this question during the beginning phase of the project).
- What do you plan to accomplish by the mid-project check-in? (See the check-in section for some generic goals; edit to suit your particular project)
- What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project? How will you mitigate them?

Please do not paste in these questions and answer them. Instead, use them as guidelines to check for completeness as you draft a cohesive proposal document.

It is OK to have one idea more fleshed out than the other two if you want to indicate a strong preference.
