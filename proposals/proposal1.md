# Breakout

We want to implement Breakout, the arcade game, using the pygame library. By doing this, we will get to explore:
- Object-oriented programming
- Event-driven programming
- Computer Graphics  

Our minimum viable product includes having:
- A paddle that follows the mouse or the arrow keys horizontally
- A ball which bounces when it hits objects
- Some objects/bricks which disappear when they are hit
- A score counter or timer

Our stretch goal is to add a couple of extra features such as:
- Require multiple hits to each brick to make it disappear
- The bricks change color each time they are hit
- The ball changes angle when it hits the wall, making it more unpredictable
- Add levels where the ball moves faster, with multiple balls, or the paddle becomes smaller
- Add sound effects with different actions
- Add menu and/or endscreen pages
- Add multiple lives or make the game reset after ending
- Track how many times player has won or lost
- Add a leaderboard allowing highscorers to enter their name
- Add color schemes, maybe even a color scheme selector option or as a reward for finishing a certain level

Our Breakout game is meant for anyone who wants to play games. However, because it is a primarily visual game, people with impaired vision may not be able to play. Also, the control interface is a computer mouse and keyboard, so anyone who cannot physically operate these devices would need some sort of controls adaptation in order to play.

For each member, the learning goals are: to learn how to develop a game (Izumi) and to learn how to use the pygame library (Lilo). By the Mid-Project check-in, our product will overall be done but not polished, as in having most of the features of a working minimum viable product. Also, both members are expected to understand the basics of how to use the pygame library by the check-in. The major risk for successfully completing this project is the spring break as we both are traveling away and are not able to gather together physically to collaborate on the project. We will mitigate this risk by setting up a communication channel over facebook messenger and updating each other about changes.
