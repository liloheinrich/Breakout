# Coronavirus data visualizer
We want to visualize the data for Coronavirus pandemic as it is the most relevant today. We will be using the dataset given by Johns Hopkins University on github (link: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We may use one or several of the following libraries. 

    matplotlib
    Seaborn
    ggplot
    Bokeh
    pygal
    Plotly
    geoplotlib
    Gleam
    missingno
    Leather
    numpy

By doing this, we will get to explore:

    Efficient data visualization
    Data scraping skills
    Machine learning

Our minimum viable product includes having:

    The number of confirmed cases in 50 top affected countries
    The number of death in the 50 countries we selected

Our stretch goal is to add a couple of extra features such as:

    Timeline feature (how the number in those affected countries changed overtime)
    Rank (top 1 to top 10)

Our data visualization is for everyone. It is universal, so whoever would like to see and compare the numbers among countries are able to see the trend of the pandemic. The only limitation would depend on how simple yet effective we will be able to visualize the dataset. If the dataset does not do "story-telling" well, there will be less meaning to the visualization.

For each member, the learning goals are: to learn how to code for data visualization in python (Izumi) and learn how to create meaningful and easy-to-understand graphics (Lilo).
